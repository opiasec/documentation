## Communication Philosophy

Our communication is based on three pillars: **Transparency**, **Asynchronous Communication**, and **Respect**. Our goal is to create an environment where everyone, regardless of their timezone or experience level, can participate in discussions and contribute to the project.

Important decisions and the project's history must always be public and traceable.

## Official Channels

To maintain organization, each type of communication has its appropriate channel.

### 1. GitHub Issues
- **Usage:** This is our main channel for work management. Use it to:
    - Report detailed `bugs`.
    - Propose `new features`.
    - Discuss specific and trackable tasks.
- **Do not use for:** General questions or open-ended discussions.


### 2. Discord
- **Usage:** For real-time, informal, and social communication. Use it for:
    - Asking quick questions.
    - Social interaction and networking with other community members.
    - Asking for help when you're "stuck" on something.
- **Important:** Any relevant decision or technical information that arises in the chat **must be moved to an Issue or Discussion** to be publicly recorded. Chat is volatile by nature.

Here you can join our Discord server: [Join Opiasec Discord](https://discord.gg/hXdwCW7e87).

### 3. Synchronous Meetings (Video Calls)
- **Frequency:** They will be rare. The priority is asynchronous communication.
- **Usage:** Only when strictly necessary for:
    - Complex design sessions that require real-time brainstorming.
    - Demos of important features.
    - Project retrospectives.
- **Requirements:** All meetings must have a clear agenda, be announced in advance, and have their minutes/recordings published (in our Discord).

## Etiquette and Best Practices

- **Be Respectful:** Aligned with our [Code Of Conduct](/docs/governance/code-of-conduct.md).
- **Prefer Asynchronous:** Give others time to respond.
- **Search Before Asking:** Check if your question has already been answered in Issues, Discussions, or the documentation.
- **Be Clear and Concise:** In Issues, provide all necessary context (steps to reproduce, versions, etc.).
