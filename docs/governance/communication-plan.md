## Communication Philosophy

Our communication is based on three pillars: **Transparency**, **Asynchronous Communication**, and **Respect**. Our goal is to create an environment where everyone, regardless of their timezone or experience level, can participate in discussions and contribute to the project.

Important decisions and the project's history must always be public and traceable.

## Official Channels

To maintain organization, each type of communication has its appropriate channel.

### 1. GitHub Issues
- **Usage:** This is our main channel for work management. Use it to:
    - Report detailed `bugs`.
    - Propose `new features` or `new labs`.
    - Discuss specific and trackable tasks.
- **Do not use for:** General questions or open-ended discussions.

### 2. GitHub Discussions
- **Usage:** For conversations that are not direct tasks. Use it to:
    - Ask general questions about the project ("How do I set up X?").
    - Propose early-stage ideas for debate.
    - Share how you are using the platform.
    - Community announcements.

### 3. [Team's Choice: **Discord**]
- **Usage:** For real-time, informal, and social communication. Use it for:
    - Asking quick questions.
    - Social interaction and networking with other community members.
    - Asking for help when you're "stuck" on something.
- **Important:** Any relevant decision or technical information that arises in the chat **must be moved to an Issue or Discussion** to be publicly recorded. Chat is volatile by nature.

### 4. Synchronous Meetings (Video Calls)
- **Frequency:** They will be rare. The priority is asynchronous communication.
- **Usage:** Only when strictly necessary for:
    - Complex design sessions that require real-time brainstorming.
    - Demos of important features.
    - Project retrospectives.
- **Requirements:** All meetings must have a clear agenda, be announced in advance, and have their minutes/recordings published (in GitHub Discussions, for example).

## Etiquette and Best Practices

- **Be Respectful:** Aligned with our `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
- **Prefer Asynchronous:** Give others time to respond.
- **Search Before Asking:** Check if your question has already been answered in Issues, Discussions, or the documentation.
- **Be Clear and Concise:** In Issues, provide all necessary context (steps to reproduce, versions, etc.).

## Decision-Making Process
For significant changes to the project's architecture, governance, or roadmap, we will use a simplified RFC (Request for Comments) process through **GitHub Issues**, using a specific template to ensure the proposal is well-detailed and open to public discussion for a specified period.
