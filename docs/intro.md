# Overview

The *opiasec* project is an open-source initiative aimed at enhancing application security through community-driven efforts, collaboration, and knowledge sharing.

We strongly believe in a culture based security, where security is not just a responsibility of a few, but a shared commitment across the entire community (or an organization). Our goal is to empower individuals and organizations to take proactive steps in securing their applications and systems.
