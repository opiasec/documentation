# Requirements

Before you deploy, make sure you have the following:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) (We recommend using Kind for local development, as it allows you to run Kubernetes clusters in Docker containers.)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/pt) (> 18)
- Makefile

:::info[To contribute]
For local development and testing, you may also need [Go](https://go.dev/). The frontend is using [Angular](https://angular.dev/).
